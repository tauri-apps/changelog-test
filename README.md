# change 2
I have to disagree with Shakespeare, I know I shouldn't because he is the bard - but really, a rose by any other name might **smell** as sweet, but if there is someone who can't smell or see - then the semantic name is just as important. A name that we agree upon is very helpful. I would propose a modification to the line:

```
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
```

to

```
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, 
but everyone needs to know that the other name is the right name.
```
